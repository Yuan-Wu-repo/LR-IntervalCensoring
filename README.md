This project comprehensively studies the analysis of the interval-censored data under the Cox proportional hazards model</b>. 


The following tasks are facilitated by the functions included.

- Estimating the Sieve spline-based MLE of the Cox regression parameters and the hazard function

- Estimating the variance of the MLE of the Cox regression parameters using two existing approaches

- Generating the knot sequence for B-splines (or I-splines)


The script for the simulation aims to compare <b>our proposed likelihood ratio (LR) testing approach</b> and the existing Wald testing approaches. 

The script for the <b>hemophilia data</b> applies different testing approaches analyzing this public available data set.
