This project contains R functions and a simulation script for the analysis of the Cox PH model with interval-censored data.


Includes functions for:

- Estimating the Sieve spline-based MLE of the Cox regression parameters and the hazard function

- Estimating the variance of the MLE of the Cox regression parameters using two existing approaches

- Generating the knot sequence for B-splines (or I-splines)


The simulation script aims to compare our proposed likelihood ratio test and the Wald test.
